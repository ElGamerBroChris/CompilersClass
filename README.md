## Lexical Analyzer
The Lexical analyzer followed the code to read a file from this tutorial:
https://www.thecrazyprogrammer.com/2017/02/lexical-analyzer-in-c.html
This lexical analyzer must be able to analyze a file for all its tokens and point out an error if a word couldn't be identified.

###### Here are the requirements:

The things it must identify are:
- Reserved identifiers [IMPLEMENTED]
- Logic operators [IMPLEMENTED]
- identifiers [IMPLEMENTED]

- natural numbers[IMPLEMENTED]
- octal numbers[IMPLEMENTED]
- hex numbers[IMPLEMENTED]
- float point numbers[IMPLEMENTED]
  
- comments (ignore them)[IMPLEMENTED]
- Delimitators (won't check if they're complete)[IMPLEMENTED]
- Arithmetic signs[IMPLEMENTED]
- Relationship operators[IMPLEMENTED]
- punctuation[IMPLEMENTED]
- assign operator[IMPLEMENTED]
- blank spaces (ignore them)[IMPLEMENTED]

It must display the results.

## Syntax Analyzer
The Syntax Analyzer is usually performed while the lexical analysis happens as well in order to save time in case of error.
For terms of simplicity I avoided that and wrote the syntax analyzer as if a file was generated by the lexical analyzer.
### It's important to note that it's not the same grammar for the two of the analyzers made in this repository.

The grammar used is the one in the picture, only added a some comparing symbols due to simplicity.
